Problem Statement:
The SportRadar Event Explorer project aims to develop a comprehensive solution for managing, visualizing, and analyzing sports competition data extracted from the Sportradar API. The application will parse JSON data, store structured information in a relational database, and provide intuitive insights into tournaments, competition hierarchies, and event details. This project is designed to assist sports enthusiasts, analysts, and organizations in understanding competition structures and trends while exploring detailed event-specific information interactively.

Business Use Cases:
  Event Exploration: Enable users to navigate through competition hierarchies (e.g., ATP Vienna events).
Trend Analysis: Visualize the distribution of events by type, gender, and competition level.
Performance Insights: Analyze player participation across singles and doubles events.
Decision Support: Offer data-driven insights to event organizers or sports bodies for resource allocation.
